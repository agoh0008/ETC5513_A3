# Introduction 


.content-box-soft[ 
- Cancer is a complex and diverse group of diseases that can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, lifestyle, or background. 
]


.content-box-soft[ 
- Cancer occurs when normal cells in the body start to grow and divide uncontrollably, forming a mass or tumor. 
]

.content-box-soft[ 
- The treatment of cancer has garnered the attention and investments of numerous nations to come together and pool in resources along with their medical expertise to combat this deadly disease.
]

.content-box-soft[ 
- Cancer is a significant public health challenge affecting millions of people worldwide and is a leading cause of death globally. In this presentation, we will discuss the different types of cancer, their causes, symptoms, and treatment options, and the current state of cancer research and treatment.

Cancer deaths increase with age:
- **"50-69"** and **"70+" age groups** had upward trends in cancer deaths
- Younger age groups had relatively stable trends with fewer cancer deaths
- **From 1990-1998:** "50-69" age group had highest number of cancer deaths 
- **1998-Present**: "70+" age group surpassed "50-69" in cancer deaths
- **From 1995 onwards:** "70+" had a steeper upward trend in cancer deaths compared to "50-69" age group

# Is the world making progress against cancer ?

.Large[.gray[.bolder[Methodology]]]

- Absolute number of deaths and rate of deaths are __heavily affected by the number of people constituted in each age group__. 

- As __age distributions can drastically differ, a statistical treatment is required__.

- As a result, in Epidemiology, __age standardized death rates__ are calculated to study the overall progress of treatments against diseases.


$$Standardization\;rate = \frac{\sum(r_iP_i)}{\sum{P_i}}$$
Where, 

$r_i =$ is the age-group specific rate for age group $i$ in the population being studied.

$P_i =$ is the population of age group $i$ in the standard population.

# Is the world making progress against cancer ?

.Large[.gray[.bolder[Key results]]]

- Based on the current study, __cancer deaths__ were observed to rise by approximately __73% globally since 1990__.
- __Non-age standardized death rate__ due to cancer was observed to __rise by approximately 30%__. 
- __Age standardized death rate__ due to cancer was observed to __drop by 6% since 1990__.

# Conclusions

## Key highlights

.content-box-green[
In conclusion, the analysis of deaths by different cancer types provide valuable insights into the global burden of cancer:

1. Lung cancer emerges as the __leading cause of cancer-related deaths, highlighting the urgent need for effective prevention and targeted interventions__. Colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, and liver cancer also contribute significantly to the cancer mortality burden. 

2. Cancer deaths are found to be __more prevalent in older age groups__, as shown by rising trends in the __“50-69”__ and __“70+”__ age groups over time. 

3. Countries with relatively __smaller populations__, such as __Greenland__ and __Mongolia__, are also revealed to have higher cancer death rates among the elderly population. 

4. There is a __positive relationship__ between Sales of Cigarettes and Lung Cancer Mortality Rates, which mean as the __average daily number of cigarettes sold increases, the death rates of lung cancer tend to increase as well__. 

5. While the death rates increased by __73% since 1990__, age standardized death rates have been observed to __drop by approximately 6%__ since 1990. This metric indicates that __if the world population would have remained constant and the age profiles would have been consistent across all age groups__, the number of deaths have in fact dropped by 6%.

6. The above metrics indicate that while the total number of global deaths have increased, the world is in fact making a __slow but critical progress against cancer__.]
